    title: 'The Future of Decentralized Content Platforms',
    body: `Web3 is fundamentally reshaping how we think about content ownership and monetization. In traditional platforms, the creator is essentially a renter — the platform owns the audience, the data, and all the revenue levers.

Decentralized platforms flip this entirely. By anchoring content to a blockchain, creators carry their audience across platforms like a portable social graph. Tokens become the new follower count, but one with real financial value attached.

The implications are staggering. A writer who builds an audience of 50,000 token holders isn't locked to Substack or Medium — they can migrate their community to any platform that speaks the same protocol. Content becomes portable in ways that feel genuinely revolutionary.

But decentralization also introduces real complexity. Key management, gas fees, wallet UX — these are real friction points that have stalled mainstream adoption repeatedly. The platforms that win won't just be decentralized, they'll hide the decentralization almost entirely from users who don't care about it.

The next 24 months will be critical. Either the tooling matures to the point where onboarding doesn't require a CS degree, or the window closes again and centralized platforms consolidate further.`,

    title: 'AI Writing Assistants: Tool or Crutch?',
    body: `Every few months a new wave of discourse crashes across developer Twitter about whether AI coding/writing tools are making us dumber or smarter. The truth, as always, is more nuanced than either camp wants to admit.

I've been using LLMs heavily for writing for the past year, and my honest take: they're extraordinarily good at eliminating blank-page paralysis but genuinely dangerous for the critical revision phase.

The problem isn't that AI produces bad prose — it's that it produces plausible prose. Plausible enough that you stop interrogating it. You read it, your brain pattern-matches to "this sounds like writing," and you hit publish. The specific texture of your thinking, the weird turns of phrase that make your voice yours — all sanded down into confident, competent beige.

The unlock, for me, was treating AI outputs as raw material rather than drafts. Let it generate three different structures for the same argument. Use whichever skeleton makes sense, but write the actual sentences yourself. The efficiency gains stay; the voice erosion stops.`,

    title: 'Building a Zero-Config Design System in 2025',
    body: `Design systems have gone from optional luxury to table stakes for any team shipping at scale. But most tutorials start from a blank Figma file and end 47 hours later with a half-finished token library that nobody actually uses.

Here's the approach that actually worked for my team: start with the constraints, not the components.

Instead of asking "what components do we need?" ask "what decisions do we want to centralize?" Spacing? Color? Typography? Start there. A single well-maintained set of spacing tokens prevents more inconsistency than a hundred component variants ever will.

The zero-config part comes from leaning hard into CSS custom properties with sensible defaults. Every component should work out of the box with no configuration, but every aspect should be override-able through the token layer. This isn't a new idea — it's just one that most design systems implement backwards.

Start with tokens → build utilities → compose components. In that order. Always.`,

    title: 'The Async Mindset: How Remote Teams Actually Ship',
    body: `Four years of fully-remote work taught me one thing above all else: the bottleneck is almost never effort, almost always coordination.

Async-first teams don't just move meetings to Loom videos. They redesign decision-making entirely — defaulting to written proposals, time-boxed comment windows, and explicit decision owners. The goal isn't to eliminate real-time communication; it's to make real-time communication an intentional choice rather than the default.

The most underrated async tool isn't Notion or Linear or Slack. It's a well-written decision log. A living document that captures what was decided, why, what alternatives were considered, and who was consulted. Six months later when someone asks "why do we do it this way?" — you have an answer that isn't someone's faulty memory.

The teams that struggle with async are almost always missing one thing: explicit norms around response time. Without them, every message carries implicit urgency. With them, you can genuinely disconnect, do deep work, and trust that the team will hold together.`,

    title: 'On Shipping Small: The Art of the Micro-Product',
    body: `The mythology of startup success is almost entirely built around scale. The billion-user platform. The category-defining network. But there's a quieter, more interesting story playing out in the margins: tiny products, built by one or two people, generating enough revenue to be genuinely life-changing for their makers.

I call these micro-products. Not side projects (implies something parked, waiting for "some day"). Not indie apps (implies a certain platform-dependent aesthetic). Micro-products: deliberately small, deliberately focused, deliberately profitable.

The magic of going small is that you get to know your users personally. Not through NPS surveys and cohort analysis — through DMs and emails and actual conversations. That proximity to real humans using your thing is intoxicating, and it makes the product dramatically better faster.`,
